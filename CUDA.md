# 100 days of CUDA challenge

The challenge started in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/4Tg4TkJQzE).

Official onboarding guide:

- Join the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/4Tg4TkJQzE) and announce you are starting the challenge.
- Read PMPP (Programming Massively Parallel Processors) if you never heard of CUDA.
- Check the repos of Lynn and Hamdi for inspiration: https://github.com/1y33/100Days and https://github.com/a-hamdi/cuda/
- Both Lynn and Hamdi had ZERO knowledge when they started.
- Deliver code consistently for 100 days without any gap. Every 10 day you can claim a badge.
- Write in your repo what you did every day (e.g. Day 1: I coded a kernel that adds two vectors).
- No code, no badge, no challenge.
- It doesn't matter what kernel you code, just code.
- Don't ask me if you will get a job with CUDA. Pray Lord Jensen Huang (üôè ) every morning and you'll land one.
- If your girlfriend/boyfriend broke up with you, it's a good reason to start coding. It eases the pain.
- Don't complain you slept only 4 hours today, be happy you have 20 hours to code CUDA kernels.

### I deserve a badge, how do I get one?

Announce your repo in the Discord channel and we will verify if you actually delivered high quality code consistently. If you did, your name will appear here.
